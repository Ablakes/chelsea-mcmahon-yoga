      Hi! My name is Chelsea McMahon. I earned my 500hr. RYT at Boundless Yoga
      in Stroudsburg, PA this year. I first tried yoga about … 12 years ago in
      the downstairs of the house I rented when I was a student at the local
      university. I’ve always enjoyed movement and grew up dancing, tumbling,
      hiking like crazy, and riding my bike. I’m also an art freak which has
      found its way into my practice as well.

      Yoga and I hit it off from day one. All these new types of movement I got
      to try?! And for better or worse I’ve always been an inquisitive person,
      so the philosophical and personal side to yoga had me. I was hooked. What
      gave me the most appreciation for a practice was actually losing it for a
      while and coming back. From learning how I act and react in a yoga class I
      use it in every part of my life.

      My teaching style is based on a lot of experimentation with fluidity,
      mixing balance work with momentum, stretching and strengthening the
      muscles, and not taking the self too seriously. I’m a music lover, and
      good music is essential to me in a class (or quite frankly, I don’t want
      to hear anything at all). I love, love, love new and creative forms of
      meditation. No one’s meditation practice grows in the same way. I’d say my
      intention is always to help myself and others find a way to relax and feel
      good about just being who they are. Come!
